# Credit-Card-Fraud-Classification
This repository contains information and material for the Credit Card Classification, a personal project. The purpose of the project is to construct robust neural network architectures, which will be able to distiguish a real from a fraud transaction, while tackling the overfitting and underfitting problem. The project was written in Python. Main tasks where data splitting, data scaling and classification (with Random Forest and mostly Multi-Layer Perceptron, with hyperparameter tuning and evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall, Roc-Auc).
